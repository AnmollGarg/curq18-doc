# Creating and Designing Webpages

Build, customize, and publish responsive web pages using the drag-and-drop website editor in CURQ 18.

### 1. Opening the Website Editor

To access the website frontend and editing tools:

1. Open the CURQ 18 main dashboard and click the **Website** app icon.
2. CURQ opens your public website in live preview mode with the website administrative control bar fixed at the top of your screen:
   * **Edit** *(Blue button)*: Opens the visual block editor sidebar and unlocks inline canvas editing.
   * **+ New**: Quick-creation menu to add new pages, blog posts, events, products, or job openings.
   * **Website Switcher Dropdown**: If your database manages multiple websites, a website selector dropdown appears in the top control bar *(press hotkey `Alt + w`)* displaying the active website name. Click it to switch frontend context between your different brand websites before creating or editing pages.
   * **Mobile / Desktop Switcher**: Toggle icon to preview how pages adapt across desktop screens and mobile devices.
   * **Page Status Toggle**: Switch between **Unpublished** *(red)* and **Published** *(green)*.
   * **Site Menu**: Direct navigation to explore pages, configure SEO metadata, and access backend website settings.

### 2. Creating a New Webpage

To start a new webpage:

1. In the top website control bar, click **+ New** *(if multiple websites are configured, ensure you have the intended website selected in the top website switcher dropdown first)*.

   ![CURQ Website top control bar highlighting the + New button](images/website-top-bar-new-button.png)

2. In the quick-creation overlay dialog, click **Page**:
   * CURQ provides direct creation shortcuts for multiple content types, including **Page**, **Product**, **Course**, **Livechat Widget**, **Blog Post**, **Event**, **Forum**, and **Job Position**.

   ![Quick creation modal showing Page, Product, Course, Blog Post, and Event options](images/website-new-content-modal.png)

3. In the **New Page** template selector dialog:
   * Select a layout category from the left sidebar *(such as **Basic**, **About**, **Landing Pages**, **Gallery**, **Services**, **Pricing Plans**, **Team**, or **Custom**)*.
   * Choose a pre-designed page structure from the library, or select **Blank Page** to build from scratch.

   ![New Page template selection dialog showing template categories and pre-designed layout cards](images/website-new-page-template-modal.png)

4. In the title prompt modal:
   * **Page Title**: Enter a clear name for your new webpage *(such as `Info`, `Services`, or `About Us`)*.
   * **Add to menu**: Keep this checked to automatically insert a navigation link for this page into your primary header navbar. Uncheck this if you are creating a standalone landing page.
   * Click **Create**.

5. CURQ generates the new page, inserts the new menu link in the website navbar, and immediately opens the visual drag-and-drop editor.

### 3. Adding Content Using Building Blocks

The drag-and-drop editor provides a library of pre-designed responsive blocks in the right-hand **Blocks** sidebar:

1. In the right sidebar, ensure the **Blocks** tab is selected.
2. Browse through the available block categories:
   * **Structure**: Fundamental layout containers including **Banner**, **Cover**, **Text - Image**, **Columns**, **Masonry**, and **Image Gallery**.
   * **Features**: Engagement components including **Features**, **Comparison Table**, **Process Steps**, **Team Profiles**, **Client Testimonials**, and **FAQ Accordions**.
   * **Dynamic Content**: Connected data widgets that pull live CURQ records into your webpage, such as **Contact Form**, **Blog Posts**, **Products**, and **Call to Action**.
   * **Inner Content**: Smaller building blocks to nest inside columns, such as **Headings**, **Paragraphs**, **Icons**, **Buttons**, **Dividers**, and **Rating Stars**.

   ![Website editor blank canvas showing building block categories and inner content sidebar](images/website-editor-blank-canvas-blocks-sidebar.png)

3. Click and hold any block card in the sidebar *(such as **Intro**)*.
4. Drag the block over to the main page canvas.
5. As you move the block, CURQ displays a blue horizontal insertion line indicating where the component will drop.
6. Release the mouse button to drop the block into your page.

### 4. Editing Text and Button Links Inline

Every element on the canvas can be edited directly without opening separate dialog forms:

1. Click directly on any headline, subtitle, or paragraph on the page canvas to select and activate the text block.
2. Type or paste your replacement text directly on the canvas.

   ![Headline text selected and edited inline directly on the webpage canvas with floating AI assistant pill](images/website-editor-inline-text-editing.png)

3. When a text block is selected, the right **Customize** sidebar displays the **Inline Text** panel (which remains hidden for non-text components like images or layout containers):
   * **Text Format**: Select heading levels *(Header 1 to Header 6, Display 1 to 4)*, paragraph body text *(Normal, Light, Small)*, code blocks, or blockquotes.
   * **Typography Styles**: Apply **Bold**, *Italic*, Underline, or Strikethrough formatting, or click the eraser icon to remove formatting.
   * **Font Size & Color**: Adjust pixel font size, apply text font colors from the palette, and apply background highlighter colors.
   * **Lists & Alignment**: Set text alignment *(Left, Center, Right, Justify)*, and create unordered bullet lists, numbered ordered lists, or interactive checklists.
   * **AI Text Assistant & Copywriter**: While AI in CURQ is strictly limited to text (it does not generate layouts or images), it is not just a raw prompt generator. It operates in three distinct modes:
     * **Prompt Generation**: When no specific text is selected (cursor simply placed in a text block), clicking the AI wand opens the **Generate Text with AI** modal to draft new copy from a conversational prompt.
     * **AI Copywriter**: When specific text is selected on the canvas, clicking the AI wand opens the **AI Copywriter** dialog to generate 3 alternative variations with one-click tone and length filters *(Correct, Shorten, Lengthen, Friendly, Professional, or Persuasive)*.
     * **AI Translation**: When text is selected, the **Translate** dropdown appears in the sidebar to translate the selected text into other configured website languages.
   * **Animations & Highlights**: Click **Animate** to configure text entrance animations, or click **Highlight** to apply stylistic animated marker strokes.

4. Click on any button component on the canvas to configure button actions:
   * **Link (URL)**: Enter an external URL, search for an internal site page by typing `/`, or link to a section anchor by typing `#`. Toggle **Open in New Window** to control tab behavior.
   * **Label**: Edit button display text directly in the sidebar or inline on the canvas.
   * **Style**: Switch button appearance between **Button Primary**, **Button Secondary**, **Light**, **Dark**, or **Outline** styles.
   * **Size**: Choose button size between **Small**, **Medium**, or **Large**.

### 5. Replacing and Formatting Media

To replace stock placeholder pictures with company media:

1. Click directly on any image on the canvas.
2. In the right **Customize** sidebar under the **Image** section, click the green **Replace** button to open the media library:

   * **Images**: Search copyright-free illustrations and photos *(such as built-in Undraw vector illustrations)*, add an image by URL, or click **Upload an image** from your computer.
   * **Documents**: Select downloadable files or PDF documents uploaded to your database.
   * **Icons**: Choose from hundreds of vector line icons for feature lists and service cards.

3. Select your chosen image or illustration and click **Add**.
4. In the right-hand **Customize** sidebar under the **Image** section, configure presentation settings:
   * **Media Action**: Click **Replace** to swap the asset, or click the link chain icon to make the image clickable.
   * **Description & Tooltip (SEO)**: Enter an **Alt tag** in the Description field for accessibility/SEO, and set a hover **Title tag** in the Tooltip field.
   * **Transform & Crop**: Use crop and transform icons to adjust framing directly inside the editor.
   * **Filter & Style**: Apply visual filters *(such as Warm, Cold, B&W)* and choose border shapes *(Default, Rounded Circle, Shadow, or Thumbnail)*.
   * **Quality & Sizing**: Choose width scaling *(25%, 50%, 100%, or Default)* and adjust the image quality compression slider.

### 6. Customizing Section Layout and Styling

When an entire block section is selected, the right sidebar switches to the **Customize** panel to control section geometry:

1. Click on the outer border of any block section on the canvas.
2. In the right **Customize** sidebar, configure layout options:
   * **Width**: Set container width to **Full Width** *(stretching across the entire browser window)* or **Boxed** *(centered with standard container gutters)*.
   * **Height**: Set section height to **Full Screen** *(100vh)*, **Auto**, or custom minimum pixel heights.
   * **Padding & Margins**: Use top and bottom spacing sliders to control white space between sections.
   * **Background**: Select a section background:
     * **Color**: Pick a solid background shade or gradient.
     * **Image**: Upload a full-width background photo with customizable opacity overlay and parallax scrolling effects.
     * **Video**: Embed an MP4 or streaming video loop as a dynamic background.
   * **Shape Dividers**: Add decorative top or bottom vector wave, slant, or arrow dividers to create modern section transitions.
   * **Animation**: Add entrance animations *(such as Fade In, Slide Up, or Zoom In)* that trigger as visitors scroll down the page.

### 7. Managing Site-Wide Themes and Brand Styling

To maintain visual consistency across all pages without restyling blocks one by one:

1. In the top right sidebar, click the **Theme** tab.

   ![Website editor Theme settings tab displaying global color swatches, typography, and button styles](images/website-editor-theme-settings-tab.png)

2. Configure site-wide brand styles:
   * **Color Palette**: Choose a curated multi-color palette preset, or click individual color swatches to define your brand primary, secondary, accent, and neutral tones. All blocks immediately update to match your chosen palette.

   ![Theme color palette presets dropdown displaying curated color harmony combinations](images/website-editor-theme-color-palette-presets.png)

   Selecting a color palette immediately updates button accents, navbar highlights, and footer colors across the entire website:

   ![Website canvas reflecting newly selected theme color palette with updated button and footer tones](images/website-editor-theme-palette-applied.png)

   * **Fonts**: Select primary heading fonts and body text font pairings from integrated Google Fonts libraries.
   * **Buttons**: Set default button corner roundness *(Sharp, Rounded, or Pill)*, drop shadow depth, and border weight.
   * **Layout**: Choose default container widths, card styling, and input field aesthetics.

### 8. Previewing Responsive Layouts

### 9. Saving and Publishing the Page

Once your design and copy are finalized:

1. Click the **Save** button in the top right corner of the website control bar to preserve all canvas edits.

   ![Website top bar highlighting the Save button to preserve all page edits](images/website-editor-save-changes-button.png)

2. By default, newly created pages remain in **Unpublished** state, making them invisible to regular website visitors while visible to logged-in administrators.
3. To make the page live on the internet, click the red **Unpublished** toggle switch in the top bar.
4. The switch turns green and displays **Published**. Visitors can now access the page through your navigation menu or direct URL.
