Monitor, publish, and manage eCommerce products and eLearning course pages in CURQ 18 using the frontend Page Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Products** option requires the **eCommerce** app to be installed, while the **Courses** option requires the **eLearning** app. If either app is not installed in your database, its corresponding option will not appear in the **Site** menu.

### 1. Accessing Product & Course Pages

Administrators can inspect all published and unpublished catalog items directly from the frontend top bar without opening backend settings:

* **Product Pages**: In the top administrative bar, click **Site** > **Products**.
* **Course Pages**: In the top administrative bar, click **Site** > **Courses**.

Both menus open a unified manager interface providing synchronized List and Kanban views tailored to your products and courses.
